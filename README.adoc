= Bootstrap UI and JWT Tokens for the Authorization Server

You will find a version of this application in the https://github.com/dsyer/spring-security-angular/tree/master/oauth2-vanilla[source code in Github] which has a whitelabel HTML interface and HTTP Basic authentication. This one has a pretty login page and user approval page implemented similarly to the way we did the login page in https://github.com/dsyer/spring-security-angular/tree/master/single[the single server sample]. It also uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JWT[JWT] to encode the tokens, so instead of using the "/user" endpoint, the resource server can pull enough information out of the token itself to do a simple authentication.
